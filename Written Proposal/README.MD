## 😫 The Problem: The "Doomscrolling-to-Dining" Gap

There is a fundamental disconnect between how our generation consumes food content and how we actually cook. We've identified three specific friction points:

### The "Video Gap" (Tech Friction)
95% of Gen Z engages with food content, but short-form video is chaotic in the kitchen. Users suffer from the **"wet hand problem"**—constantly pausing and rewinding fast-paced videos while their hands are covered in oil or chicken juice, just to find the one second where the chef mentions the oven temperature.

### Decision Fatigue & Anxiety
"Girl Dinner" isn't just a meme; it’s a symptom of being overwhelmed. Users are intimidated by recipes that require expensive equipment or ingredients they’ll only use once. They order takeout because it feels safer than risking money on groceries they might ruin.

### The Market Gap
Current solutions are polarized. Utility apps are boring databases that feel like homework. Social platforms are entertaining but lack the actual tools to help you cook. There is no **"middle layer"** that acts as a digital sibling to tell you, "You can definitely do this."

## 🎯 Target Audience: The "Inflation Generation"

Plated targets **Gen Z and Young Millennials (18–34)** who are "anxious but ambitious" in the kitchen.

### Economic Reality
This generation is deeply price-sensitive. They view food waste as a financial loss. When they see a recipe calling for expensive niche ingredients, they don't see a delicious meal; they see a grocery bill they can't justify. They need **"pantry logic"** to stretch their groceries.

### How They Think
They suffer from **"competence gaps."** They understand food theory from watching YouTube but lack tactile confidence. They require validation. They need a tool that feels like a safety net, not a textbook.

## 💡 The Solution: A Personality-Led Utility

Plated isn't just a recipe saver; it’s a bridge that simplifies the culinary journey.

* **AI Extraction:** We use **Gemini** to instantly parse unstructured TikToks, YouTube videos, and photos into clean, step-by-step guides. This solves the video gap—no more pausing with dirty hands.
* **Magic Swap:** This solves economic anxiety. It uses culinary logic to rewrite recipes based on budget (e.g., "Make this cheaper") or diet. It acts as the **"Eitan" in their pocket**, telling them it's okay to swap shallots for onion powder.
* **SOS Layer:** A context-aware panic button on every recipe step. If a user thinks "My pan is smoking" or "This is too salty," the SOS button gives an immediate, specific fix.
